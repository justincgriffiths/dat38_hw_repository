I think the best type of model you can use is a linear regression for the problem you're trying to solve and the value you're trying to predict. In an effort to speed up the CLV calculations, instead of formulating a newer/faster method, it would be best for you to use a historical data set which contains users' profile and the CLV your company already calculated for them. Using that data to train your model, you will now be in a position to make a quick educated prediction about what value a new customer might bring. Another approach, might be to use historical profitability data (instead of the CLV calculations) to train, then to make a forward looking value prediction on the fly when a new customer checks out.
